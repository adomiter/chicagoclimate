# chicagoclimate
This package contains Climate data for the city of Chicago and a function to help create choropleth maps easily. 
This package was inspired by the presentation given by Qinyun Lin. The functions and data are different. I also learned to 
intall packages using devtools::build(). I followed the instructions here: https://evamaerey.github.io/package_in_20_minutes/package_in_20_minutes

## Goals

My goal was to have a package with lots of data regarding the climate for the city of Chicago that can be used for exploratory data analysis 

### Prerequisites
